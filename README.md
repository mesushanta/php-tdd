# php-tdd

This exercise is about test driven development in php. I am using PHP unit test library. I am using Laravel framework and developing test cases.

## Test Created
Firstly I created two rooms and two users each one with one premium and one non-premium feature.
I have created a test class inside tests folder ./tests/Features/CheckRoomAvailabilityTest.php
I have four test case possibilities of being user and room premium and non-premium.
 - User Premium, Room Premium
 - User Premium, Room non-Premium
 - User non-Premium, Room Premium
 - User non-Premium, Room non-Premium
